## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

Learned a lot about the CSS grid. I now find it really useful for making responsive layouts. Also tried making my font responsive and worked pretty well with this code:

```css
font-size: clamp(1rem, calc(1rem + 2vw), 2rem);
```

### Useful resources

- [A Interactive Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) - This helped me a lot with keeping interest learning the grid layout.
